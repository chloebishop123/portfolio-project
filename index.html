        <h1>Hi! I'm Chloe.</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio page.</h2>
        <p>I've spent the last couple of months teaching myself how to code, and I've gotten to the stage where I can stick a few projects together into a portfolio. Please feel free to have a nosey and send me feedback!
            <br>
            I'm a copywriter learning to code in my spare time, so anything here is self-taught and still a work in progress. So far, I've really enjoyed getting to grips with JavaScript and using HTML/CSS to flex my creative muscles outside of my day job.
